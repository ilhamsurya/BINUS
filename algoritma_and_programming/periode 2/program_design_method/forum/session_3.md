## Theory Understanding
You guys already know what selection and repetition is and there are variant technique inside of them, tell me the different between do-while , while and for with its practical example



## Jawab 

Difference between each loop, as describes:

While loop behavior will checks the condition first and then executes statement(s) using pattern like this
while (condition) {
Statements; // loop body
}

Do While behavior will loop and execute the statement(s) at least once, then the condition is checked.
do{
Statements; //loop body
} while (condition);

For loop behavior will sets index on each iteration, to the next value from the object being iterated over. Whatever to set index to in the loop is ignored at that point.
for (index; condition; index update)
{
statements;
}
