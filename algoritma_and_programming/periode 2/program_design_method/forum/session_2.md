## Theory Understanding
You guys already know what is Algorithm, but how to develop a good algorithm? please explain it... and by developing good algorithm you guys will know what is pseudocode and flowchart, when do we need to use each one of them ?

## Solution
A good algorithm can be achieved by fulfilling several things
1) Deep understanding of the problem and how to solve it
2) Determine the input/output involved in the problem
3) Create solution that solved the problem
4) Test the algorithm by making a test case
5) Refactor to achieve a more optimal algorithm

Flowcharts can be used to design the main thinking behind the algorithm, so that everyone can get clear idea before
